### Problem to solve
In this fast pace life, we need to save time where ever we can. So when people need to buy or plan for a new vehicle, they need to spend a lot of time searching for the right vehicle of their choice. They need to physically visit outlets of different dealers to check a particular car and trial/test drive it. This process consumes a lot of time.
The sole purpose of this project is to solve this problem.

### About Application

The application is PAAS which facilitates the booking of a test drive for a variety of vehicles of their choice.
The platform allows users to choose vehicles of their choice by examining the specifications and variants offered.
And by using an integrated payment system, book a trial for the vehicles at a reasonable price.
